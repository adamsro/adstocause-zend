*Note , this is not fully complete . I am working on it to add additional functionalities .

Creating a blog using Zend Framework 1.9 . I am learning zend framework and also learning git .

Added authentication , authorization , pagination etc.

4 roles are there . Guest , User , Blogger and Admin .

Guest can view all posts and comments. 

User can post comments . 

Blogger can add, edit posts and add comments.

Admin can do everything. 

Actually need a Roles table and the foreign key will be placed in the Users table . 

But for the simplicity I have added the roles in the users table itself . 

As I am new to Zend_ACL and Zend_Auth I have made this for my convinience :)

Added registration form and forgot password request form . Need to implement it . Working on it .

There may be errors from my part as I am learning . You can download and use at your own risk .
